      <h1>Content models</h1>
      <p>In HTML 4 there were only two main content models, block
      and inline level elements. <strong>Block</strong> level elements would stack on top of each
      other in normal document flow while <strong>inline level</strong> elements typically appear
      within the flow of text content.</p> 
      <p>In this example the heading 1 and the
      paragraphs are block level items, while the bold tags and the link below
      are examples of inline level elements.</p> 
      <p>In HTML5 new content models have
      been created to expand the structure and semantic capabilities of HTML.
      There are seven main models: <strong>Flow, Metadata, Embedded, Interactive,
      Heading, Phrasing, and Sectioning.</strong> To learn more about them, visit the
